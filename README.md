Welcome! Did you ever have the need to have some Javascript form validation within your symfony application?
Well I did! So I made this little bundle to do it for me.

Do me a favor and give it a try and if you have any problem please create a issue or make a pull request.

Some of the things that the bundle support:
- Automatic constraint mapping
- Form Collection (including prototype)
- Validation groups
- Data class constraints

Now let's go to the [documentation](doc/index.md) and get started.

[Install and configure](doc/install.md)
-------------
`composer require boekkooi/jquery-validation-bundle dev-master`

All the installation instructions are located in the [documentation](doc/install.md).


Demo
-------------
Yeah so .... nope there is no real demo **but** what you can do is the following:
```BASH
git clone https://github.com/boekkooi/JqueryValidationBundle.git
cd JqueryValidationBundle

curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install

php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 tests/Functional/app/web.php
```
Now you can see the functional test pages, these should give you a good idea of what is possible.


License
-------------
This bundle is under the MIT license.
